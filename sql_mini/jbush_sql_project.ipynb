    "# Objective\n",
    "For this mini-project, students are presented with a series of questions and required to write SQL queries to answer the questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The database used for this exercise is a fake database for a Country Club. It contains three tables:\n",
    "- **Members,** containing member rows related to columns for the member id, surname (last name), first name, address, zipcode, telephone, recommended by, and join date \n",
    "- **Bookings,** containing booking rows related to columns for the booking id, facility id, member id, start time, and slots reserved\n",
    "- **Facilities,** containing facility rows related to columns for the facility id, name, member's cost, guest cost, initial outlay expense, and monthly maintenance expense \n",
    "\n",
    "# Presentation\n",
    "The SQL queries used to query the Springboard mySQL database are provided in the .sql document **jbush_sql_project.sql.** This notebook is written to pursue the, 'Excellence,' designation for the assignment:\n",
    "- Download the raw files;\n",
